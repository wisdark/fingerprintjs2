# API reference

## Installation

The library is shipped in various formats:

### Global variable

```html
<script>
  // Initialize the agent at application startup.
  const fpPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    script.onload = resolve
    script.onerror = reject
    script.async = true
    script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/'
      + '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@3/dist/fp.min.js'
    document.head.appendChild(script)
  })
    .then(() => FingerprintJS.load())

  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get())
    .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
</script>
```

Or a synchronous code that blocks the page during loading and therefore isn't recommended:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@3/dist/fp.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Initialize the agent at application startup.
  const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  fpPromise
    .then(fp => fp.get())
    .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
</script>
```

### UMD

```js
require(
  ['https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs@3/dist/fp.umd.min.js'],
  (FingerprintJS) => {
    // Initialize the agent at application startup.
    const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

    // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
    fpPromise
      .then(fp => fp.get())
      .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
  }
)
```

### ECMAScript module

```bash
# Install the package first:
npm i @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

```js
import FingerprintJS from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs'

// Initialize an agent at application startup.
const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

;(async () => {
  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
  const fp = await fpPromise
  const result = await fp.get()
  console.log(result.visitorId)
})()
```

If you face a TypeScript error that occurs in a FingerprintJS file,
see the [TypeScript support guide](typescript_support.md).

### CommonJS

```bash
# Install the package first:
npm i @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
# or
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs
```

```js
const FingerprintJS = require('@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs')

// Initialize the agent at application startup.
const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load()

// Get the visitor identifier when you need it.
fpPromise
  .then(fp => fp.get())
  .then(result => console.log(result.visitorId))
```

## API

#### `FingerprintJS.load({ delayFallback?: number, debug?: boolean }): Promise<Agent>`

Builds an instance of Agent and waits a delay required for a proper operation.
We recommend calling it as soon as possible.
`delayFallback` is an optional parameter that sets duration (milliseconds) of the fallback for browsers that don't support [requestIdleCallback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback);
it has a good default value which we don't recommend to change.
`debug: true` prints debug messages to the console.

#### `agent.get(): Promise<GetResult>`

A method of an Agent instance that gets the visitor identifier.
We recommend calling it later, when you really need the identifier, to increase the chance of getting an accurate identifier.
The returned object format:

```ts
interface GetResult {
  visitorId: string
  confidence: {
    score: number
    comment?: string
  }
  components: {
    [key: string]:
      { value: any, duration: number } |
      { error: object, duration: number }
  }
  version: string
}
```

The returned object fields:

- `visitorId` The visitor identifier
- `confidence`.`score` The confidence score.
    This is a number between 0 and 1 that tells how much the agent is sure about the visitor identifier.
    The higher the number, the higher the chance of the visitor identifier to be true.
- `confidence`.`comment` Additional information for the confidence score. A human-readable text.
- `components` A dictionary of components that have formed the identifier.
    The keys are the component names.
    `value` is a component value (in case of success).
    `error` is an error object (in case of an unexpected error during getting the component).
- `version` The fingerprinting algorithm version which is equal to the library version.
    See [the version policy guide](version_policy.md) for more details.

See the [extending guide](extending.md) to learn how to remove and add entropy components.

#### `FingerprintJS.hashComponents(components: object): string`

Converts a dictionary of components (described above) into a short hash string a.k.a. a visitor identifier.
Designed for [extending the library](extending.md) with your own components.

#### `FingerprintJS.componentsToDebugString(components: object): string`

Converts a dictionary of components (described above) into human-friendly format.
